Isn't it obvious? We need a new Bill of Rights. The our current bill of rights works really well and we should keep it.  But ask yourself: <i>does it go far enough</i>?

<p>The gist of the current Bill of Rights is that it protects the individual against government intrusion.  But in these modern times, corporations are just as as pervasive in our 
lives as government.  The reasons against government intrusion are obvious: they protect an individual from being thrown in a hole by the government without a fair trial.  But what about 
our interactions with corporate entities?
</p>

<p>
Individuals are at a disadvantage when dealing with corporations.  A large corporations in general will have far more money and influence than a private individual, rendering a justice seeking 
private individual's tort or contract suit to be met with little success.  Shareholder suits and holding boards of directors to be criminally liable are also mostly ineffective, especially as a 
protection for an individual.  The current system has been around for a long time; lawyers know how to work it in a manner not obvious to a private individual.
</p>

<p>
And yet, we are so dependent on them for vital services such as healthcare, energy services, education, entertainment, and other vital services it is important to keep the system moving forward, to protect
the individual, and to ensure corporations can continue to do business in a predictable manner without fear of capricious lawsuits.
</p>

<p>
Finally, in the age of the knowledge worker, the creation and protection of intellectual property rights must be streamlined.  This New Bill of Rights greases the wheels of tomorrow's society.

<b>A New Bill of Rights</b>

<p>And as such, the people will take and then retain the following rights (vs. non human entities)</p>

<ol type=1>

<li>The right to be entertained is absolute and shall not be superceded.</li>

<li>So long as goods or services are both plentiful and useful, ramifications of providing such services will not be considered relevant.</li>

<li>The people retain right to not pay for services in lieu of submitting to constant, pervasive surveillance.</li>

<li>The people will submit to limited surveillance despite paying for service, so long as surveillance is used to improve product.  The people may comment anonymously.</li>

<li>The access to a useful product may not be curtailed unless it intereferes with other rights.</li>

<li>The market shall decide; in near monopoly situations, or in the absence of multiple brands, consumers will have a "choice of package".</li>

<li>The freedom from having to choose, especially if it is just so tiring.  See the TED talk <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice.html">"Paradox of Choice"</a>.</li>

<li>To be protected from omissions of taste; the guidance of the app store shall be nigh absolute.</li>

<li>The right to become famous.</li>

<li>In the face of a deluge of content, it must be filtered before it can be consumed.</li>

<li>The right to become a brand.  An invidual may commit copyright infringement as personal use until the brand reaches critical mass.  The age of Brand Viability is established as Tweendom.</li>

<li>The right to high speed internet access.</li>

</ol>

Postscript: I'm not sure what % of this is tongue in cheek.
