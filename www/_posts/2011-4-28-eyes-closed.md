One thing I like to do from time to time, every so often, is to draw things with my eyes closed.  Sometimes you have drawn a thing so many times that you can do it from 
pure muscle memory. When I do it, I visualize the drawing on the paper, and "trace" the mental image.  I'm not sure this says anything at all about artistic 
ability or quality.  But I do think there is some value in the process and the end product itself.  Sometimes the eyes-closed picture will
stimulate some other ideas.  This particular drawing led to me drawing more chickens and birds.

<table style="width:400px;">
<tr>
<td><a href="/static/images/chickenbird.png"><img width="200" src="/static/images/chickenbird.png"></a></td>
<td><a href="/static/images/chickenbird_eyes_closed.png"><img width="200" src="/static/images/chickenbird_eyes_closed.png"></a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">Open</td>
<td style="text-align:center">Closed</td>
</tr>
</table>

Anyway, the whole reason for this post is that I like the look of the eyes-closed version.  That c.b. has a very devlish look in his eye indeed.

I hit up Google for some eyes open/closed drawings and the results were surprisingly mundane, except for [this gem](http://a-hole-in-the-head.blogspot.com/2007/07/eyes-wide-shut-in-1947-life-magazine.html).  
Chic Young could draw the heck out of Dagwood!
