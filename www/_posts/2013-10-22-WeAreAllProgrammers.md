The <a href="http://code.org">Code.org</a> site has this quote featured on the page:

"Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think." - STEVE JOBS, THE LOST INTERVIEW

The fact that Jobs didn't program notwithstanding, this statement is false.  Well sort of false, in that it is one of many disciplines that encourages you to plan and analyze.  Programming and thinking are mutually exclusive.  What a lot of programmers do these days is akin to painting by numbers or building a Lego set.  While those can be satisifying and constructive activities,  I wouldn't necessarily call it art.  Just like it helps to know how to draw to create art, so to, knowing how to program can help with solving problems (and more broadly, "thinking".  Though I personally don't think a lot when I program. I do more of my thinking outside of programming, then sit down and type, and repeat.  To each his own there.)

Anyway, there are all kinds of ways to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Lady-Tiger-Puzzles-Recreational/dp/048647027X">teach logical thinking</a> without programming. In fact, I'd try to do that first!  

Now, lets say you do want to teach kids programming.  What I do is try to teach my kids a little programming here and there, mostly by doing one of two things:

1. Launching a Python <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> and printing their names a few hundred times.  
2. Launching a Python REPL or Excel (a *great* problem solving tool) and figuring out how to solve a math problem from school, or coming up with our own situational problem and solving that.  Time/Distance/Velicoty problems are a great way to teach algorithmic problem solving (programming, and algebra, and calculus, and physics, etc).  Kids of all ages understand speed and sort of distance, so its a good place to start.  If you have a particular geeky kid, you can probably throw in a circuit problem.  But know your audience.  Sports statistics or Pokemon cards could also be a good source of numbers.

(Digression: Python 3 is syntatically big step back in terms of usability for teaching kids to program!  For example, change from 'print "item"' to 'print("item")' is a gigantic step back in teaching usability.  I spend more time explaining syntax than explaining what the program is doing.)</em>

(Digression digression: In fact, I can't think of any syntactically good programming language for teaching younguns.  Fortran and Visual Basic are to me the best candidates, but Python is what I use.  Python 2.x was fine, so long as you stick to long procedures and avoid objects and functions. Admit it, GOTO is a way better starting tool than functions.)
