"Education Technology", or "Ed Tech", is a somewhat hot area right now, in terms of Venture Capital interest.  I'm having a hard time understanding why, exactly, that is.  There are two potential reasons for interest:
1.) The field is "ripe for disruption", that is, if someone could just write some game changing software, they could make all teh moneys.
2.) The interest in education is largely egalitarian and humanitarian and we just want to try to improve things.

To which I say:
1.) Wouldn't potential venture capital money be better spent as a gift to a school system?  I mean then individuals can use it as a tax write off.
2.) What the field of education needs is less technology and software, and more money to teachers and kids.  Computers at school: fine.  Certain creative and literary software: sure.  IPads: eh.  As a thought experiment, write down the 3 most vital pieces of technology that a school uses.  I came up with a list of zero items, myself.  Unless you count lightbulbs, furnaces, and the kitchen equipment used to supply lunches.
3.) Selling technology to schools uses money that could otherwise be spent on teachers and kids, so it really actually makes the whole situation worse.
4.) So despite an egalitarian or humanitarian interest, education technology will most likely make education worse (though it could enrich it's purveyors).

Much has been written about current tech providers for charter schools, and needless to say, it's a pretty scuzzy situation.  I see it as a win-win-win-lose-lose situation:  Providers win because they make money.  Politicians win becuase they get to claim they are forward thinking and using the latest technology, while spending less money, and most importantly, they get lobbying money from the tech providers.  Schools and administrators win because they can claim they are running their schools for less money.   Teachers lose because they don't get paid as much and have a harder time finding a job.  And of course, students lose because the products really, really suck.

A couple of rules of thumb to go by:
1.) Schools are not businesses.
2.) Students are not consumers, nor are they clients.  They are usually just kids.
3.) Any company with a true humanitarian interest in this space should be operated as a non-profit, if educational technology is their only business.  If it is not their only line of business, they should sell products to schools at a significant discount.
