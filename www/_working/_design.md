I think I may be a weirdo.  When I buy something, I look to a list of features that I need, quality, durability.  Last on the list is what the thing actually looks like.  I have never chosen one website or service over another based on what it looks like.  I'm feature and cost driven first and foremost, and usually, that gets you to where you need to be.

Too much emphasis placed on design, specifically how it looks.
When you hire a designer, they are going to design.
This is a problem if you have an existing product. They are going to want to redesign it.
   - likewise, your programmers are going to want ot re-write it.
   
DON'T!
  - incremental improvements (itunes... unimprovements)
  - spin off new services instead, let your programmers/designers greenfield that.
  - even if it is a "crappy" design. speed it up, clean it up, maybe move something around to make it a little bit more sane. but by and large, leave it.
  - don't remove features.  they are there, it's a sunk cost. Why remove it?
