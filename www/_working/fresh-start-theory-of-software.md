0. All software has some worth, as it is a manifestation of human endeavor and represents future work.
1. It is worthwhile to enter the same space existing, popular softare (even as overwhelmingly popular as Office), as your software represents a fresh start.
  - can grow with users
  - can adapt to new challenges and paradigms
  - can add features as needed
  - cultivate your own userbase, culture, value

1. removing features.  why?
2. reasons to remove existing features:
   - irrevocably slows down your softare (rejoinder is , speed the feature up )
   - you can profitabley add it back in at a later date
   
   
Apple and MS seem to not realize this:

  - no reason for it. The designers are too much incontrol
  - itunes dj, Google Reader, etc.
