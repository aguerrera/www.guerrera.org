About Andy and This Site
------------------------

I have 3 kids and a wife and I'm a programmer living in Dublin, Ohio.  I'm also a lawyer.  

I wrote the software that powers this site (hosted on Amazon's S3 service). You can [check it out](https://github.com/aguerrera/Garoozis "Garoozis") if the mood grabs you.  All files are written in notepad++.

Here is a self portrait:
