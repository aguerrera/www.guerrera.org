In our house, after presents are opened on Christmas morning, we have stage 2: the XMas challenge.

The challenge is basically a series of clues, with one leading to the next.  A clue may also have a task for one of the kids to 
perform.

As a prize, they get some books. This year they got a sweet Time-Life book I bought off of Amazon, 
as well as some of these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_9?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=david+macaulay&x=0&y=0&sprefix=david+mac%2Caps%2C311">David Macauly</a> 
books that I hope aren't relegated to the scrap heap of time and content.  They also got business cards.

Here is the 2011 challenge.  One clue is <a href="/clue2011.html">here</a>.  The final clue involved a QR code, which led them
