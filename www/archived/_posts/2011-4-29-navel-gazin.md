I'm going to sub-title this
[Omphaloskepsis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphaloskepsis "it means
navel gazing"). Under a different guise it might be solipsism or undivided self-interest. 

It's woven in to the very fabric of the internet, and it's that
quality that, while we now have an incredibly powerful communication
tool and unprecidented contact with other humans, we use this only to
essentially argue, preen, and gabber about our own narrow interests,
or nothing at all. I really don't care about cat pictures... unless
it's wearing a grapefruit peel for a hat, or wearing/doing something equally jocular.

Navel gazing is a powerful force and a prime mover. And IMO it really
just has to be right up there with the survival instinct, the
biological drive to propogate one's genes, and the unalienable right to be entertained.
