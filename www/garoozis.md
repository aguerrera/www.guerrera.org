Garoozis: Create Static HTML Files with Razor
---------------------------------------------

When I rebuilt this site, I wanted to create my own blogging
engine. That was part of the fun of doing it.  You get to constantly
tinker with the mechanics.  And that's what makes it fun.

So I set out to create my own blog maker.  I hate messing around with
servers: for me, static html works just fine.  So my design choice was
to create a project that some kind of layout templates and some kind
of content templates and slapped them together, and generated static
html.  In turn, I could post this static html to Amazon S3, which is
Amazons storage service.
